Welcome! I'm a third year Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof.Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk/).
I am currently a research intern at <img src="../images/tongyi.png" width="20px" style="display:inline;"> Tongyi Qwen, Alibaba Group, where I focus on agents and reinforcement learning.
Previously, I was an applied scientist intern at <img src="../images/amazon.png" width="20px" style="display:inline;"> Amazon Stores Foundational AI, where I worked with [Dr. Wenlin Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qwo2A24AAAAJ) and [Dr. Zheng Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=P6fwn4AAAAAJ&hl) on deep research agents. I received the EMNLP 2024 **<font color="#FF0000">outstanding paper award</font>**.


## Research Interest
<!-- My primary research focus is on **retrieval** and **logical reasoning**, with a special interest in the theory and application of legal NLP, large-scale knowledge graphs, and recommender systems. -->
- **Agent & Reinforcement Learning**: [DeepPlanner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12979), [CoCHPL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17922)
- **Data Synthesis & Augmentation**: [🏆 GoldCoin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11149), [AutoSchemaKG](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2505.23628)
- **Legal Reasoning & Safety**: [Legal Rule Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14104), [Privacy Checklist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10053), [Multi-step Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05197)
